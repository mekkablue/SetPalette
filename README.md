Glyphs.app palette for toggling stylistic sets in Edit view. Thanks to Marcus Sterz for the idea.

### Installation

1. Go to *Window > Plugin Manager.*
2. Look for *Set Palette*, and click the *Install* button next to it.
3. Restart Glyphs.

### Usage Instructions

1. Open an Edit tab with text in it.
2. Click the checkboxes corresponding to the stylistic sets you want to activate. Click *On* to activate all, and *Off* to deactivate all sets. If the font has the corresponding stylistic sets in its OpenType features, they should immediately be triggered.
3. After switching to a new tab, click *Activate* to apply the current choice of sets to the current Edit tab.

### Requirements

The plug-in works in Glyphs 2.5.2 in High Sierra. I can only test it in current app and OS versions, and perhaps it works on earlier versions too.
